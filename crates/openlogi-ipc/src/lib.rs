//! The agent↔GUI IPC contract.
//!
//! The tarpc service definition and the wire types it carries are re-exported
//! at this crate's root; [`transport`] is the cross-platform local-socket
//! transport that carries them, and [`client`] is how every client reaches an
//! agent over it — the connect handshake, the protocol-version policy, and the
//! observe loop's connection state live there once rather than in each consumer. This is a
//! leaf crate — it depends on `openlogi-core` and nothing else internal to the
//! workspace — so the GUI (a pure IPC client) can pull in the wire contract
//! without linking `openlogi-hid`/`hidpp`/`async-hid`. The agent-side runtime
//! that answers these RPCs (hook runtime, device I/O, the Actions Ring's
//! session state, …) stays in `openlogi-agent-core`, which depends on this
//! crate rather than the other way around.
