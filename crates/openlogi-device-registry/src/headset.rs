//! Logitech gaming-headset raw-HID identities.
//!
//! These headsets don't speak the eQuad HID++ receiver protocol mice and
//! keyboards use. Their dongle exposes a proprietary vendor collection
//! instead, and no publicly documented reverse-engineering of that protocol
//! is known yet (checked against the `HeadsetControl` project's Logitech
//! drivers, none of which match this family's usage page). So, like Litra,
//! these are surfaced as standalone raw-HID devices for identity only: no
//! battery, mute, or sidetone control until the wire protocol is worked out.
