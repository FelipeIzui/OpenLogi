//! HID++ keyboard Fn-lock reads and writes — fn inversion `0x40a3`
//! (multi-host), with the single-host `0x40a2` as fallback.
//!
//! Both features expose one `fnInversionState` byte with the meaning the
//! specifications give it: **inversion on** means a bare F-key performs its
//! printed media/shortcut function and Fn+F-key produces the F-key;
//! **inversion off** means a bare F-key is the F-key and Fn+F-key the
//! function. OpenLogi's `fn_lock` setting is the F-keys-first state, so
//! `fn_lock = true` writes inversion *off* — see [`FnLockState`].
//!
//! Multi-host keyboards store the state per Easy-Switch slot. The `0x40a3`
//! spec offers `0xFF` for "the current host". The MX Keys S firmware answers
//! `0xFF` *reads* correctly but silently drops `0xFF` *writes* (Solaar issue
//! 2280 has the traces; Solaar carries the same workaround), so a write looks
//! up the slot in `0x1815 HostsInfo` and addresses it explicitly, and fails
//! when that lookup fails on a keyboard that has the feature — a `0xFF` write
//! there is exactly the one the firmware ignores. A read addresses `0xFF`
//! directly: it works on every known keyboard and never depends on `0x1815`,
//! so a busy hosts-info cannot hide the state the keyboard holds.
