//! Implements the `AdcMeasurement` feature (ID `0x1F20`) that reports a
//! device's battery as a measured voltage plus a link/charging flags byte.
//!
//! Wireless G-series headsets expose `0x1F20` and none of `0x1000` / `0x1001`
//! / `0x1004` (verified on a G733; the Linux kernel reads a G935 the same
//! way), so without this feature the inventory probe finds no battery source
//! for them. Like `BatteryVoltage` (`0x1001`) the feature reports no
//! percentage — callers estimate one from the voltage.
//!
//! `getAdcMeasurement` (function `0`) reads the battery. The firmware also
//! broadcasts the same payload unsolicited as event `0` when the reading or
//! the link changes, which
//! [`AdcMeasurementFeature::is_status_broadcast`] recognizes.
//!
//! The wire layout is not in a public Logitech spec: the voltage as a
//! big-endian millivolt `u16` followed by one flags byte was
//! reverse-engineered. The flag values follow the Linux kernel
//! (`hid-logitech-hidpp.c`, `hidpp20_map_adc_measurement_1f20`): bit `0` means
//! the device is linked, bit `1` charging, bit `2` charge complete.
